# Graduate Stipend Tax Estimator
This script calculates taxes for graduate students based on the proposed
tax reform using the three proposed tax brackets for single filers.
If filing otherwise, the current 2017 tax brackets are used.

NOTE: this is a work in progress and I am still working on getting
the information of proposal included. If you would like to contribute,
please see steps below.

# DISCLAIMER

This is in no way, shape, or form, a replacement for calculating your
actual taxes. I am also not a tax expert by any means. I try to keep
this script up to date with information as I read/understand it. This
is only meant to give you a general idea of how graduate student taxes
will change.
